🌿 urbFARMS: Microfarming for Sustainable Urban Living
urbFARMS was developed as part of a hackathon conducted at Dayananda Sagar Academy of Technology and Management (DSATM). The hackathon focused on solving real-world problems aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Our idea promotes microfarming — enabling people to grow vegetables and fruits in compact spaces at home such as balconies, terraces, or backyards.

🚀 Project Vision
urbFARMS aims to:

Empower individuals to grow their own food in urban settings.

Promote sustainable, organic living through home-based farming.

Help users sell surplus produce, creating a source of additional income.

Encourage a greener, healthier lifestyle by integrating agriculture into daily urban life.
